# StockSystem
The project was to make a stock system for a music shop. 
This project was done using C++. The framework catch2 was used for unit testing.

# Scenario:-
A music shop sells CDs, DVDs, magazines and books. It is in need of a stock management system to maintain stock records with a text (command line) menu with options to allow the user to perform the following functionality:

- sell items
- restock items (increase stock quantity)
- add new items
- update stock quantity (correct stock levels)
- view a report of sales
It should also be possible to load and save the stock data to/from a file.

Within my project i have completed all the above criteria.

# How to run

- Open the file on Command line/terminal.
- I have created a "Makefile" to compile the program. To run this "Makefile" simply type "make" in the command line/terminal.
- Then you can run the program by typeing the command "./store".
